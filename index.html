            <h3>Project 1: FDP (Fedex Developer Portal)</h3>
            <p>One of the key projects I have worked on is the FedEx Developer Portal, where I was responsible for the
                design, development, and implementation of custom AEM components, templates, and workflows to enhance
                content management and improve user experience. In this project, I built reusable AEM components using
                HTL and Sling Models, which allowed for efficient content delivery and streamlined front-end/back-end
                collaboration. I also handled Digital Asset Management (DAM), ensuring that digital assets were properly
                organized, optimized, and easily accessible, adhering to FedEx’s content strategy.

                Throughout the project, I utilized AppDynamics and Splunk to conduct performance monitoring, identifying
                and resolving bottlenecks to ensure high availability and low latency during peak traffic periods. My
                experience working with REST APIs via AEM’s Sling framework enabled seamless data retrieval and
                submission between backend systems. Additionally, I worked closely with content authors to ensure
                content was aligned with branding and messaging guidelines, providing authoring support to facilitate
                efficient content creation and publishing.

                Collaboration was key to the success of this project, as I partnered with UX/UI designers, project
                managers, backend developers, and QA teams to participate in Agile ceremonies and ensure that project
                goals were met on time. I also contributed to technical documentation and provided post-deployment
                support, minimizing downtime and ensuring smooth handovers to operations teams. Through this project, I
                gained extensive experience in cloud-based deployments, CI/CD pipeline management, and security best
                practices, making sure the portal adhered to compliance standards and remained secure in production
                environments.

                This project allowed me to showcase my AEM development skills, performance optimization expertise, and
                collaborative abilities, contributing significantly to the successful delivery of a high-performing and
                scalable digital portal for FedEx.</p>

            <h3>Project 2: Avis Budget Group</h3>
            <p>In this project, I played a key role as part of an Agile team responsible for enhancing the digital
                presence across multiple domains (AU, NZ, US, CN). My primary responsibilities included Content
                Management through AEM, where I worked closely with business stakeholders to ensure seamless content
                delivery, align brand messaging, and optimize user engagement across various regions. I designed and
                developed reusable AEM components using Java and the OSGi framework, ensuring flexibility and
                reusability across different domains and brands (Avis, Budget, Payless, Budget Truck).

                I was actively involved in creating workflows and schedulers to automate and manage recurring tasks,
                such as content publishing, data synchronization, and system maintenance, ensuring smooth and efficient
                operations across the different brand portals. My role also included deploying code to various
                environments, from development to production, using tools like Jenkins and AWS, ensuring continuous
                integration and delivery (CI/CD).

                Additionally, I managed AEM configurations to ensure the application runs smoothly on the server,
                optimizing the portal for high availability and performance across multiple domains (AU, NZ, US, CN). I
                collaborated closely with cross-functional teams, including UX/UI designers, content authors, backend
                developers, and QA teams, to align project goals, provide technical insights, and ensure timely
                delivery.

                This project strengthened my expertise in multibrand AEM development, cross-domain content management,
                workflow creation, server deployments, and AEM configuration tuning, while working in a dynamic Agile
                environment.
